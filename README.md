## End-users status

* You cannot withdraw or send tokens from/to the network or exchanges because the network does not accept new transactions.
* You can check your wallet balance, related nodes or active delegations through the wallet checker provided by the "Monitor" website here: [https://monitor.tara.community/](https://monitor.tara.community/)
* You can register on the webiste using your wallet even if you are not connected to the Taraxa network (it's just about signing a message with Metamast, no transaction involved, no gas, no fee, you're safe).
* You can configure Metamask by setting the network RPC URL to `https://mainnet.rpc.taraxa.ovh`. Use chain id `841` and token symbol `TARA` (leave the explorer field blank as it's not available yet). Then you should see your balance.

## Network status

* network is still stale/stuck as **we need a few more validators to come online**.
* the RPC loadbalancer is up and running with a few nodes behind, if you want to join the party, just  let us know.

#### Why?

* To create a block and accept transactions, validator nodes need to reach a consensus of 67% of the total votes.
* Validators have vote power based on the amount of delegated $TARA end-user have made.
* With the recent shutdown of the core team servers, vote power has been re-balanced and we don't have enough online validators to reach the 67% threshold.
* To explain what (probably) happened, let's say with hypothetical values:
  * Community validators had 80% of votes
  * Core team validators had 20% of votes
  * With the core team shutting down their nodes, we might think we still have enough votes to run the network. Problem is: a substantial amount of community validators were offline or don't have updated their nodes to the latest version, leading us to a state where we have something like 55% of the votes.
